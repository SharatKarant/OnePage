Certainly! To achieve this, you can modify the service-worker.js file to intercept requests for the "contact.html" page when the user is offline and serve an "offline.html" page. Additionally, you can include a button in the "offline.html" page that allows the user to redirect to the "index.html" page. Here's how you can do it:

Create offline.html with a redirect button:
html
Copy code
<!-- offline.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Offline</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>You are currently offline</h1>
    <p>Please check your internet connection and try again.</p>
    
    <!-- Button to redirect to index.html -->
    <button onclick="redirect()">Go to Home</button>

    <script>
        function redirect() {
            window.location.href = '/index.html';
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
